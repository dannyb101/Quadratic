# Quadratic

This project was centered around manipulation of quadratic functions.

The aim was to produce functions that manipulate functions between standard, factored and vertex forms. This was achieved by creating a class called QuadraticF which would take the form of the funciton and the coefficients as an input to the constructor and then produce the coefficients for the other forms of the quadratic funciton and store these as attributes. Recalling any particular funciton then did not require any conversion as this was all achieved in the constructor.

The main.cpp file is a demonstration of the functionality of the QuadraticF class and does not take any user inputs
